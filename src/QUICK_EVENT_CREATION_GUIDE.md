- Time: 10:00 AM (default)

**Calendar time slot click:**
- Date: Day of slot

## 🔍 WHAT IF...

### "I don't see the + button"

**Location:** Dashboard → Left column → Calendar card → Top right

**Looks like:** Small + icon, teal color on hover

**Alternative:** Click "View Calendar" → "New Event" (same thing)

### "Restaurant fields don't appear"

**Make sure:** Event Type = "Dining/Restaurant"

**Should see:**
- Restaurant name
- Cuisine type
- Party size
- Price per person
- Your budget

### "Find Alternatives button is missing"

**Requirements:**
1. Event Type = "Dining/Restaurant"
2. Price per person entered
3. Your budget entered
4. Price > Budget (over budget)

**If all 4 = true** → Button appears

### "No alternatives found"

**Possible reasons:**
1. No restaurants in area (try wider radius)
2. Budget too low (try increasing)
3. Cuisine too specific (try "Restaurant")
4. API keys not set (fallback to OpenStreetMap)

**Solution:** Increase budget or change cuisine to generic
