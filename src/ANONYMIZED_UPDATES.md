## 📧 Updated Email Templates

### **Tier 1 (Instant Response):**
```
Hi there! 👋

Thank you for reporting this issue with Energy Tracking. We've logged it and will investigate right away.

**Quick Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Not seeing energy graph → Make sure you've logged at least 3 energy points
2. Energy prediction seems wrong → Give it 3-5 days to learn your patterns
3. Can't find energy meter → It's the circular meter in the top-left of your dashboard

**While we investigate, here are some things that often help:**
• Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
• Clear your browser cache
• Try in an incognito/private window
• Make sure you're using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari

**We'll keep you updated!** If the issue persists after trying the above, just reply to this email with:
• What browser you're using
• What you see on screen (screenshot helps!)
• What you were trying to do

We typically respond within 2-4 hours. Thanks for your patience!

Best,
SyncScript Support Team
```

### **Tier 2 (4-Hour Follow-Up):**
```
Hi again! 👋

Following up on the Energy Tracking issue you reported.

**Did the troubleshooting steps work?** If not, we can help dig deeper:

**Advanced Troubleshooting:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
2. Test on a different device/browser
3. Try disabling browser extensions temporarily
4. Check if you're behind a corporate firewall/VPN

→ Just reply "still broken" and we'll investigate your account directly

Otherwise, reply with any new details and we'll sort it out!

Best,
SyncScript Support Team
```

## 🎯 Proactive Email Updates

### **At-Risk User (Low Engagement):**
```
Hi there! 👋

We noticed you haven't logged energy in a few days.

Quick tip: The AI Focus Agent gets WAY smarter after 5-7 days of tracking. 
Your patterns are starting to emerge, but need a bit more data.

Try this: Set a phone reminder to log 3x per day (morning, afternoon, evening).
Within 3 days, you'll see personalized task recommendations that actually match your energy!

We're already seeing patterns in your data - excited to show you what's possible! 🎯

Best,
SyncScript Team
```

### **Silent Struggle (Stuck on Scripts):**
```
Hi there! 👋

We saw you've been exploring Scripts & Templates - awesome!

Quick troubleshooting if scripts aren't running:
1. Check the trigger is set (⚙️ icon on script card)
2. Energy-based triggers need 3+ logged energy levels first
3. Time-based triggers activate within 5 minutes of set time

Pro tip: Energy-triggered scripts are magical! Set a script to run "When energy 
is 8+" (for high-focus work) and it'll auto-suggest at peak performance times.

Need help? Just reply! Otherwise, check out the video walkthrough:
