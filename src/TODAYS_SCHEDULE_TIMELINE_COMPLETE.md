## 🚀 INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS

### **Option 1: Replace Current "Today's Schedule"**

**File to edit:** `/components/TodaySection.tsx`

Find this section (around line 224):
```tsx
<h3 className="text-white">Today's Schedule</h3>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400">Your next actions</p>
```

Replace the entire card content with:
```tsx
import { TodayScheduleTimeline } from './TodayScheduleTimeline';

// In the "My Day" card:
<TodayScheduleTimeline className="flex-1" />
```

### **Option 2: Add as Separate Card**

Add a new card below the current "Today's Schedule":
```tsx
{/* Revolutionary Timeline View */}
<div className="bg-[#1e2128] rounded-2xl p-6 border border-gray-800 flex-1 flex flex-col card-hover shadow-lg hover:border-gray-700 transition-all overflow-hidden">
  <TodayScheduleTimeline />
</div>
```

### **Option 3: Toggle Between Views**

Add a toggle button to switch between list view and timeline view:
```tsx
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'list' | 'timeline'>('timeline');

// In header:
<button onClick={() => setViewMode(viewMode === 'list' ? 'timeline' : 'list')}>
  {viewMode === 'list' ? <CalendarIcon /> : <ListIcon />}
</button>

// In content:
{viewMode === 'list' ? (
  <CurrentListView />
) : (
  <TodayScheduleTimeline className="flex-1" />
)}
```

## ✨ WHAT USERS WILL SAY

> "This is like having a personal time management AI. It's not just showing me what's next—it's helping me understand my entire day at a glance."

> "The breathing NOW indicator and countdown to my next meeting... I've never been this aware of time without constantly checking the clock."

> "Seeing the actual COST of meetings ($450 for a 2-hour meeting with 3 people?!) made me way more intentional about scheduling."

> "The auto-generated prep and recovery blocks changed everything. I actually have time to breathe between meetings now."

> "The energy curve throughout the day helps me schedule my hardest work during my peak hours. I'm way more productive now."

> "This makes Google Calendar look like it's from 2010. The timeline view is SO much better than a list."
