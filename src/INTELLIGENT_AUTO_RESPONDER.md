## 🎯 How It Works

### **When an Email Arrives:**

1. **Intent Detection** (0.5 seconds)
   - Analyzes subject + body
   - Detects intent (bug, how-to, feature request, praise, etc.)
   - Identifies specific SyncScript feature mentioned
   - Assigns urgency (low/medium/high)

2. **Smart Routing** (instant)
   - **Critical issues** → Human immediately (account locked, data loss)
   - **Medium urgency** → Auto-respond + log (bugs)
   - **Low urgency** → Fully automated (how-to, praise, features)

3. **Response Generation** (1 second)
   - Feature-specific troubleshooting
   - Common issues + solutions
   - Links to relevant help docs
   - Clear next steps

4. **Automatic Follow-Up** (if needed)
   - Tier 2 after 4 hours (if no reply)
   - Tier 3 after 24 hours (if still no reply)
   - Escalate to human after 3 attempts

## 📧 SyncScript-Specific Templates

### **Energy Tracking Example:**

**User Email:**
> "The energy meter won't show my graph"

**Auto-Response (Tier 1):**
```
Hi there! 👋

Great question about **Energy Tracking**! Here's how it works:

**Quick Start:**
Click the energy meter on your dashboard and log your current energy level (1-10). The system learns your patterns over time.

**Common Questions:**
1. Not seeing energy graph → Make sure you've logged at least 3 energy points
2. Energy prediction seems wrong → Give it 3-5 days to learn your patterns
3. Can't find energy meter → It's the circular meter in the top-left of your dashboard

**Need more help?** Just reply to this email and I'll dive deeper!

**Helpful Resources:**
• View this feature: https://syncscript.app/dashboard
• Video tutorial: https://syncscript.app/tutorials/energy_tracking
• Community tips: https://syncscript.app/community/energy_tracking

Most users are up and running in 2-3 minutes with these steps. Let me know if you get stuck!

Best,

**Estimated Resolution:** 75%

### **Scripts & Templates Example:**

**User Email:**
> "How do I make a custom script?"

**Auto-Response (Tier 1):**
```
Hi there! 👋

Great question about **Scripts & Templates**! Here's how it works:

**Quick Start:**
Navigate to Scripts & Templates in the sidebar. Browse the marketplace or click "Create Custom" to build your own.

**Common Questions:**
1. Script won't run → Check that you've set a trigger (time-based or energy-based)
2. Can't customize script → Click the edit icon (pencil) on the script card
3. Script not showing → Refresh the page or check your filter settings

**Need more help?** Just reply to this email and I'll dive deeper!

Most users are up and running in 2-3 minutes with these steps. Let me know if you get stuck!

### **Bug Report Example:**

**User Email:**
> "The AI agent keeps crashing when I click on it"

**Auto-Response (Tier 1):**
```
Hi there! 👋

Thank you for reporting this issue with AI Focus Agent. I've logged it and will investigate right away.

**Quick Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. AI not making suggestions → Log at least 5 energy points first
2. Suggestions not relevant → Update your goals in Settings → Focus Preferences
3. Agent seems stuck → Try logging a new energy level to refresh recommendations

**While I investigate, here are some things that often help:**
• Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
• Clear your browser cache
• Try in an incognito/private window
• Make sure you're using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari

**I'll keep you updated!** If the issue persists after trying the above, just reply to this email with:
• What browser you're using
• What you see on screen (screenshot helps!)
• What you were trying to do

I typically respond within 2-4 hours. Thanks for your patience!

Best,
SyncScript Support Team
```

**Follow-Up (Tier 2 - 4 hours later):**
```
Hi again! 👋

Following up on the AI Focus Agent issue you reported.

**Did the troubleshooting steps work?** If not, I can help dig deeper:

**Advanced Troubleshooting:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
2. Test on a different device/browser
3. Try disabling browser extensions temporarily
4. Check if you're behind a corporate firewall/VPN

**Or I can do this for you:**
→ Just reply "still broken" and I'll investigate your account directly

Otherwise, reply with any new details and I'll sort it out!

Best,
SyncScript Support Team

## 🚨 Escalation Logic

### **When Emails Reach You:**

   - Payment failures

2. **After 3 Auto-Attempts (24+ hours)**

   - User still not resolved
   - Auto-adds context: "Attempted 3 automated resolutions"

3. **Complex Questions**
   - User replies with "still stuck"
   - Multiple back-and-forth needed
   - Requires account-level investigation

### **What You See:**
